Hi! We're MindFluX, and we make art happen!

> This is a texture mapped, game-ready model which can be used in any of your games
> Texture files are included, but the model employs mainly materials (for increased quality)
> You can use this in any of your games or apps (commercial or free) but do include us in the credits (as "MindFluX Studios" without the quotes)
> You may not edit this model (see note below) but you can re-distribute it (but include this README file)
> Also, if you make an awesome game with any of our assets, drop a comment on the model page (Sketchfab) and mention your game (We'll add your game to a list on our site!)

Thanks, 
The MindFluX Team

Note: While the CC-NoDerivs license states that the model MUST be redistributed in its original form, we are willing to let you modify the model for personal use ONLY (i.e. Removing certain mesh elements for a game, or changing the interior for a visualization)
However, you're not allowed to re-post the edited model on any marketplace (gist: editing for games is OK). If you have any doubts, drop a comment on the model page.
